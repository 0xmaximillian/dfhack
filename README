Introduction
------------

DFHack is a Dwarf Fortress memory access library and a set of basic tools using 
this library. The library is a work in progress, so things might change as more
tools are written for it.

It is an attempt to unite the various ways tools access DF memory and allow for
easier development of new tools.

Getting DFHack
----------------
The project is currently hosted on github, for both source and binaries:
  http://github.com/peterix/dfhack

* Packages

The library and tools are packaged for Archlinux and are available both in AUR
and the arch-games repository.

The package name is dfhack-git :)

Compatibility
-------------

DFHack works on Windows XP, Vista, 7 or any modern Linux distribution.

Windows 2000 is currently *not supported* due to missing OS functionality.
If you know how to easily suspend processes, you can fix it :)

OSX is also not supported due to lack of developers with a Mac.

Currently supported Dwarf Fortress versions:
* Windows
  0.31.01 - 0.31.03

* Linux
  wine together with the Windows versions

Using the library as a developer
--------------------------------

The library is compilable under Linux with GCC and under Windows with MinGW32
and MSVC compilers. It is using the cmake build system. See COMPILE for details.

DFHack is using the zlib/libpng license. This makes it easy to link to it, use
it in-source or add your own extensions. Contributing back to the dfhack
repository is welcome and the right thing to do :)

At the time of writing there's no API reference or documentation. The code does
have a lot of comments though (and getting better all the time).


Tools
-----
All the DFHack tools are terminal programs. This might seem strange to Windows
users, but these are meant mostly as examples for developers. Still, they can
be useful and are cross-platform just like the library itself.

 - dfcleanmap  : Cleans all the splatter that get scattered all over the map.
                 Only exception is mud. It leaves mud alone.
 - dfexpbench  : Just a simple benchmark of the data export speed.
 - dfliquids   : A command prompt for liquid creation and manipulation
                 (the Moses effect included!)
                 Also allows painting obsidian walls directly.
                 Note:
                 Spawning and deleting liquids can F up pathing data and
                 temperatures (creating heat traps). You've been warned.
 - dfposition  : Prints the current DF window properties and cursor position.
 - dfprospector: Lists all available minerals on the map and how much
                 of them there is.
 - dfreveal    : Reveals the whole map, waits for input and hides it again.
                 If you close the tool while it waits, the map remains revealed.
 - dfsuspend   : Test of the process suspend/resume mechanism.
 - dfunstuck   : Use if you prematurely close any of the tools and DF
                 appears to be stuck.
 - dfvdig      : Designates a whole vein for digging. Point the cursor at a vein
                 and run this thing :)

 - Your tool here:  Write one ;)

Memory offset definitions
