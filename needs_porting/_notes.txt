TODO:  
    copypaste.cpp
        high value target - a proof of concept plugin to allow copy-pasting in DF; does both terrain and buildings/constructions
    creaturemanager.cpp
        modify skills and labors of creatures, kill creatures, etc; impressive but I suspect most functions implemented elsewhere
    dfbauxtite.cpp
        changes material of mechanisms to bauxtite (ie magma-safe)
    hellhole.cpp
        instantly creates a hole to the HFS

In progress:
    hotkey-notes.lua
