<h2>Introduction</h2>
DFHack is a Dwarf Fortress memory access library and a set of basic tools using 
this library. The library is a work in progress, so things might change as more
tools are written for it.

It is an attempt to unite the various ways tools access DF memory and allow for
easier development of new tools. In general, you can use it to move memory
objects in and out of Dwarf Fortress really fast, regardless of DF version or OS.

First part of the manual deals with the basic of using DFHack as a library:
